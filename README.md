Froilan started a second job walking dogs! 
Normally he can walk one dog at a time but he can walk two if the dogs are the same size. 
Provided an array of dog sizes, how many walks will Frolian have to make?

Before you get started make sure to install the needed modules in node by running "node i"

Then to run the unit test use the command "npm test"
